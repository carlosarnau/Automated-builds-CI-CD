## Automated builds CI + CD
CD/CI are methods frequently used to deliver apps to customers making use of automation into the stages of the app development. The main concepts attributed to CD and CI are *Continuous Integration* for CI and *Continuous Delivery* and/or *Continuous Deployment* for CD. 
<p></p>

Both methods are quite common into the *DevOps* world. *DevOps* is a set of practices that brings together software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). Its goal is to make the software development lifecycle faster and provide high quality continuous delivery. But even though all three are part of the software delivery process, each has its own requirements, and more importantly, benefits. 
<p></p>

Understanding the differences between them it‚Äôs crucial to properly implementing them.

### CI (Continuous Integration)
Continuous Integration is the practice where developers merge the changes to the code base to the main branch as often as possible. These changes are validated by creating a build and then running automated tests against the build. If these tests don‚Äôt pass, the changes aren‚Äôt merged, and developers avoid integration challenges that can happen.

### CD (Continuous Delivery)
Continuous Delivery is an extension of CI since it enables automation to deploy all the code changes to an environment after the changes have been merged. This means that there is an automated release process on top of the automated testing process and that developers can deploy their changes at any time by simply clicking a button or at the completion of CI.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### CD (Continuous Deployment)
Continuous Deployment takes the process one step further than continuous delivery. Given that all changes that pass the verification steps at each stage in the pipeline are released to production. This process is completely automated and only a failed verification step will prevent pushing the changes to production.

By this time, the difference here is obvious. Continuous delivery is a partly manual process where developers can deploy any changes to customers by simply clicking a button, while continuous deployment emphasizes automating the entire the process.

## How to config automatic builds with GitHub Actions
After this brief introduction on the pilar concepts about automatic builds, I‚Äôll proceed with the teoric explanation of how to configurate automatic builds using GitHub Actions. But first of all, I would like to explain why you should use this method to create your GitHub builds:
- Avoid having the problems of ‚ÄúIt worked on my machine when I built it‚Äù.
- Eliminates the human error possibility
- Validate that your builds are running on different platforms.

Now, with that beeing clear we can proceed to cerate a automated build with GitHub actions for the first time. The main steps are:
1. First we need to **create a repository** to be able to configure an automated build.
![](gitactions1.jpg)
<p>&nbsp;</p>

2. Go to **Actions** in the menu above.
![](gitactions3.jpg)
<p>&nbsp;</p>

3. Create a **new worklfow**.
![](gitactions4.jpg)
<p>&nbsp;</p>

4. **Set up a workflow yourself**.
![](gitactions5.jpg)
<p>&nbsp;</p>

5. Edit, and when you finish press **Start commit**.
![](gitactions6.jpg)
<p>&nbsp;</p>

6. Go back to **Actions**.
![](gitactions7.jpg)
<p>&nbsp;</p>

7. Go to the workflow you just created.
![](gitactions8.jpg)
<p>&nbsp;</p>

8. **Run workflow**
![](gitactions9.jpg)
<p>&nbsp;</p>

9. Check for possible errors.

## Guide to write scripts
GitHub scripts are awesome actions that allows us to quickly interact with the GitHub **API**(application programming interface) directly from our workflow. More specifically, we will use the workflow context to script any API that we may need.
To be able to create, add or modify a script we need to:
1. Go to your workflows
![](edscript1.jpg)
<p>&nbsp;</p>

2.Open the *yml* file
![](edscript2.jpg)
<p>&nbsp;</p>

3. Make your changes!
![](edscript3.jpg)
<p>&nbsp;</p>


### Example:
```yaml       
name: Learning GitHub Script

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]

jobs:
  comment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Comment on new issue
        uses: actions/github-script@0.8.0
        with:
          script: |
              github.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: "üéâ You've created this issue comment using GitHub Script!!!"
            })
      - name: Add issue to project board
        if: contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'bug')
        uses: actions/github-script@0.8.0
        with:
          script: |
              github.projects.createCard({
              column.id: {{columID}},
              content_id: context.payload.issue.id,
              content_type: "Issue"
            })  
```           
            
            
In this example every time an issue gets opened in this repository the GitHub Script you wrote will be executed.

After doing a depth research about manual copying README files I came out with nothing. The only what I found was a script on how to render your README with GitHub Actions.

## Automatically zip and upload back to github (CD)
```yaml
name: Create release

on:
 release:
   types:
     - created

jobs:
 build:
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest

   steps:
   - uses: actions/checkout@v2

   - name: Get Composer Cache Directory
     id: composer-cache
     run: |
       echo "::set-output name=dir::$(composer config cache-files-dir)"
   - uses: actions/cache@v2
     with:
       path: ${{ steps.composer-cache.outputs.dir }}
       key: ${{ runner.os }}-composer-${{ hashFiles('**/composer.lock') }}
       restore-keys: |
         ${{ runner.os }}-composer-

   - name: Install dependencies
     run: |
       composer install -o -q

   - name: Zip Folder
     run: zip -r ${{ github.event.repository.name }}.zip . -x ".git/*" ".github/*" "phpcs.xml" "composer.json" "composer.lock" ".gitignore"

   - name: Release
     uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
     if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
     with:
       files: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}.zip
     env:
       GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
<p>&nbsp;</p>

GitHub Actions uses YAML syntax to define the workflow. Each workflow is stored as a separate YAML file in your code repository. Here is a short guide of the YAML syntax, to understand how this script is working:
1. Name: it‚Äôs optional, gives name to the workflow.
```yaml
name: Create release
```
<p>&nbsp;</p>

2. On: specifies the trigger for the workflow. In this case the workflow will be executed with the creation of a release.
```yaml
on:
 release:
   types:
     - created
```
<p>&nbsp;</p>

3. Jobs: Groups together all the jobs that run in the workflow.
```yaml
jobs:
```
<p>&nbsp;</p>

4. Runs-on: In this case it configures the job to run on the latest version of an Ubuntu Linux runner. You can specify to be reunned in another environments.
```yaml
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```
<p>&nbsp;</p>

5. Steps: Groups together all the steps. Each item nested under this section is a separate action or shell script.
```yaml
steps:
```
<p>&nbsp;</p>

6. Uses: The uses keyword specifies that this step will run v2 of the actions/checkout action. Specifically this action, checks out your repository onto the runner, allowing you to run scripts or other actions against your code (such as build and test tools). You should use the checkout action any time your workflow will run against the repository's code.
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
```
<p>&nbsp;</p>

7. Run: The run keyword tells the job to execute a command on the runner.
```yaml
run: zip -r ${{ github.event.repository.name }}.zip . -x ".git/*" ".github/*" "phpcs.xml" "composer.json" "composer.lock" ".gitignore"
```
<p>&nbsp;</p>


## Automatic builds and notifications
If you enable email or web notifications for GitHub Actions, you'll receive a notification when any workflow runs that you've triggered have completed. The notification will include the workflow run's status (including successful, failed, neutral, and canceled runs). You can also choose to receive a notification only when a workflow run has failed. For more information about enabling or disabling notifications, see "About notifications."
GitHub allows us to change our notification settings and manage our subscriptions. To do that we have to:
1. Click into the bell icon.
![](notif1.jpg)
<p>&nbsp;</p>

2. Go to Manage notifications.
![](notif2.jpg)
<p>&nbsp;</p>

3. Depending in if you want to change yout notification settings or manage your subscriptions you will chose between Notification settings or Subscriptions.
